This archive contains various files and scripts linked with the articles listed in the [How to cite](#how-to-cite) section below. It includes sample LAMMPS input files, potential files for different machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for **borophene on silver**, and various scripts for structure generation, post-treatment of data, and adaptive training of neural network potentials.

The MLIPs files included are for the following methods:
- [DeePMD](https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit)
- [n2p2](https://github.com/compPhysVienna/n2p2/)
- [NNMP](https://github.com/allouchear/NNMP-Pot)

Please [cite these articles](#how-to-cite) if you use any of the files in this archive.

## Contents of this archive

- [potential](https://github.com/colinbousige/BoroML/tree/main/potential): The potential files for the n2p2, DeePMD and NNMP MLIPs
- [lammps](https://github.com/colinbousige/BoroML/tree/main/lammps): Sample LAMMPS input files for launching an MD simulation with the n2p2, DeePMD and NNMP MLIPs
- [scripts](https://github.com/colinbousige/BoroML/tree/main/scripts): Various scripts used for post-treating the data or generating structures

## Description of the scripts

Install all necessary libraries with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Structure generators

- `BoroPy.py`:
  - Streamlit GUI tool to build and visualize borophene structures
  - Usage (local): `streamlit run BoroPy.py`
  - Or use the [online app](https://boroml.streamlit.app/)
- `xgenerate-structure`:
  - Generate a borophene structure to stdout
  - Usage: `python xgenerate-structure -h` to get the help
- `generatorfunctions.py`:
  - Set of functions to generate borophene structures, write LAMMPS input files, etc. Called in other scripts.

### Post-treatment scripts

- `gofr.c`:
  - C code to compute the radial distribution function from a LAMMPS dump file.
  - Compile with `gcc gofr.c -o GofR -lm`
  - Usage: `gofr -h` to get the help
- `xconvert`:
  - Conversion from and to VASP, N2P2 and LAMMPS
  - Usage: `python xconvert -h` to get the help
- `xGDOS`:
  - python code to read a LAMMPS dump file containing atomic velocities and compute the GDOS
  - Usage: `python xGDOS -h` to get the help
- `xLAMMPStoNNP`:
  - Convert and concatenate many dump files into a single file to use with N2P2. Also look for structure generating extrapolation warnings and store them apart.
  - Usage: `python xLAMMPStoNNP -h` to get the help
- `xOUTCARtoLAMMPS`:
  - Convert an OUTCAR trajectory file into a LAMMPS dump file
  - Usage: `python xOUTCARtoLAMMPS -h` to get the help
- `xplotLAMMPSlog`:
  - Plot a LAMMPS log file
  - Usage: `python xplotLAMMPSlog -h` to get the help
- `xprepareDPdata`:
  - Prepare the data for a DeepMD potential training from a n2p2 data file
  - Usage: `python xprepareDPdata -h` to get the help
- `xreadLAMMPSlog`:
  - Read a LAMMPS log file and extract the thermodynamic properties, prints to stdout
  - Usage: `python xreadLAMMPSlog -h` to get the help
- `xSTM`:
  - Compute an STM image from a CHGCAR or PARCHGCAR file
  - Usage: `python xSTM -h` to get the help

### Adaptive training scripts

You **will** need to adapt these scripts to your own cluster and problem...
Especially the `xjobadaptive` and `adaptive_learning/SlurmJob.py` scripts where some paths and cluster configuration are hardcoded.

- `adaptive_learning/adaptive_training.py`:
  - Script using the following classes to perform an adaptive training of a NNP and distribute jobs on the fly on a SLURM cluster
- `adaptive_learning/AdaptiveTraining.py`:
  - Class `AdaptiveTraining` to perform an adaptive training of a NNP
- `adaptive_learning/Cluster.py`:
  - Class `Cluster` to help distributing jobs on a cluster
- `adaptive_learning/SlurmJob.py`:
  - Class `SlurmJob` to help launch and follow jobs on a SLURM cluster
- `adaptive_learning/functions.py`:
  - Some user-defined functions
- `adaptive_learning/xjobadaptive`:
  - Launch an adaptive training of a NNP on a SLURM cluster. **You need to edit the script to set the correct paths and cluster definition for you**.
