## Usage

First, add this folder (`$HOME/Boro_ML/bin/iteration_tools` or wherever you put it) to your `$PATH` and `$PYTHONPATH`.

Then, go to your working directory, and make sure the following files are there:

- Necessary:
    - `stock.data`: input.data file with all stock structures
    - `initial_input.data.`: initial input.data structures dataset
    - `input1.nn`: input.nn for NNP1
    - `input2.nn`: input.nn for NNP2
- Optional:
    - `EW.data`: input.data file with only EW structures. They will be computed with VASP and added to the dataset at the beginning of the procedure.
    - `input3.nn`: input.nn for NNP3
    - etc

Then just do:

```bash
xjobadaptive node26
```

It will copy the python script `$HOME/Boro_ML/bin/iteration_tools/adaptive_training.py` in the current directory, and launch the script on `node26`.

## List of available classes:

- `SlurmJob`
    - A class to run and manage `n2p2` and `VASP` jobs on `lynx`
- `Cluster`
    - A class to access cluster state
- `AdaptiveTraining`
    - A class to perform an Adaptive Training

## List of available functions:

- `read_inputdata(filename: str)`
    - Read `input.data` file and return a list of Atoms objects and the comments
- `write_inputdata(filename: str, atoms, comments)`
    From a list of Atoms object and comments, write an `input.data` file to `filename`.
- `print_success_message()`
    - Print a geeky success message.
- `flatten(l)`
    - Flatten nested list
