## Usage

First, add this folder (`$HOME/Boro_ML/bin/iteration_tools` or wherever you put it) to your `$PATH` and `$PYTHONPATH`.

Then, go to your working directory, and make sure the following files are there:

- Necessary:
    - `stock.data`: `input.data` file with all stock structures
    - `initial_input.data.`: initial `input.data` structures dataset
    - `input1.nn`: `input.nn` for NNP1
    - `input2.nn`: `input.nn` for NNP2
- Optional:
    - `EW.data`: `input.data` file with only EW structures. They will be computed with VASP and added to the dataset at the beginning of the procedure. This file is created with the script `xLAMMPStoNNP`.
    - `input3.nn`: `input.nn` for NNP3
    - etc

Then just do:

```bash
xjobadaptive node26
```

It will copy the python script `$HOME/Boro_ML/bin/iteration_tools/adaptive_training.py` in the current directory, and launch the script on `node26`.

## Note

`stock.data` is a file containing all the structures that will be used in the adaptive learning procedure. It is usually created with the script `xLAMMPStoNNP` that gathers all structures in a LAMMPS trajectory into an n2p2-type `stock.data` file. If created by this script, all energies and forces are set to 0 since they are not known at the DFT level.

In case you have already computed some structures with DFT, you can still include them in the `stock.data` file. In this case, all structures that have non zero energies will be extracted to individual `vasp/OUTCAR_i.inp` files. This way, they will be detected as already computed and not be computed again during the adaptive learning procedure.


## List of available classes:

- `SlurmJob`
    - A class to run and manage `n2p2` and `VASP` jobs on `lynx`
- `Cluster`
    - A class to access cluster state
- `AdaptiveTraining`
    - A class to perform an Adaptive Training

## List of available functions:

- `read_inputdata(filename: str, copy_data=None)`
    - Read `input.data` file and return a list of Atoms objects and the comments. If `copy_data` is a path, it will copy the corresponding inp file to `copy_data/OUTCAR_i.inp` for all structures with non-zero energy and indices i.
- `write_inputdata(filename: str, atoms, comments)`
    From a list of Atoms object and comments, write an `input.data` file to `filename`.
- `print_success_message()`
    - Print a geeky success message.
- `flatten(l)`
    - Flatten nested list
